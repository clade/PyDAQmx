===================================
Welcome to PyDAQmx's documentation!
===================================

This package allows users to use data acquisition hardware from `National
Instruments`_ with Python. It provides an interface between the NIDAQmx driver
and Python. The package works on Windows and Linux.

.. note::

    This package is not an open source driver for NI acquisition hardware. You
    first need to install the driver provided by NI.

Compared to similar packages, the PyDAQmx module is a full interface to the
NIDAQmx ANSI C driver. It imports all the functions from the driver and imports
all the predefined constants. This provides an almost one-to-one match between
C and Python code.

A more convenient object-oriented interface is also provided, where the
mechanisms of :data:`taskHandle` in C is replaced with a :ref:`Task-object`.

The module supports callback functions, see :doc:`callback`

Installation
============

You first need to install the NI DAQmx driver provided with your
data-acquisition hardware. Please verify that you have installed together with
the driver the C API (which should be the case by default).

To install :mod:`PyDAQmx`, either download the `package`_ manually and run the
command:

.. code-block:: sh

    python setup.py install

or using `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install PyDAQmx

or using `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pydaqmx/>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda install -c conda-forge pydaqmx

You can also directly *move* the :file:`PyDAQmx` directory to a location that
Python can import from (the directory in which scripts using :mod:`PyDAQmx` are
run, :data:`sys.path`, etc.)

For more information see :doc:`installation`.

Python 3
========

The package is written for Python 2. Is is compatible with Python 3 using 2to3. To build and install the package with Python 3 ::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

If you want to run PyDAQmx without installing it, run the ``python setup.py build`` command and switch to the :file:`build/lib` directory.

Source code
===========

The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/clade/PyDAQmx>`_.

Available documentation
=======================

:doc:`installation` describes the installation and configuration of
:mod:`PyDAQmx`.

:doc:`usage` gives you some examples on how to use :mod:`PyDAQmx`.

:doc:`callback` gives code examples on how to use callback functions.

:doc:`example` gives a list of examples.

More examples are available in the GitHub
