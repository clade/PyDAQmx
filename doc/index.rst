===================================
Welcome to PyDAQmx's documentation!
===================================

This package allows users to use data acquisition hardware from `National
Instruments`_ with Python. It provides an interface between the NIDAQmx driver
and Python. The package works on Windows and Linux.

.. note::

    This package is not an open source driver for NI acquisition hardware. You
    first need to install the driver provided by NI.

Compared to similar packages, the PyDAQmx module is a full interface to the
NIDAQmx ANSI C driver. It imports all the functions from the driver and imports
all the predefined constants. This provides an almost one-to-one match between
C and Python code.

A more convenient object-oriented interface is also provided, where the
mechanisms of :data:`taskHandle` in C is replaced with a :ref:`Task-object`.

The module supports callback functions, see :doc:`callback`

Installation
============

You first need to install the NI DAQmx driver provided with your
data-acquisition hardware. Please verify that you have installed together with
the driver the C API (which should be the case by default).

To install :mod:`PyDAQmx`, either download the `package`_ manually and run the
command:

.. code-block:: sh

    python setup.py install

or using `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install PyDAQmx

You can also directly *move* the :file:`PyDAQmx` directory to a location that
Python can import from (the directory in which scripts using :mod:`PyDAQmx` are
run, :data:`sys.path`, etc.)

For more information see :doc:`installation`.

Source code
===========

The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/clade/PyDAQmx>`_.

Available documentation
=======================

:doc:`installation` describes the installation and configuration of
:mod:`PyDAQmx`.

:doc:`usage` gives you some examples on how to use :mod:`PyDAQmx`.

:doc:`callback` gives code examples on how to use callback functions.

More examples are available in the GitHub
`repository <https://github.com/clade/PyDAQmx>`_ in the :file:`PyDAQmx/example`
directory.
